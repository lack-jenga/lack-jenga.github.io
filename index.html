                During the Summer of 2023, I worked as an intern at Northrop Grumman's Tampa location. My learning experience focused mainly on systems/network engineering and technical writing tasks, subject areas I hope someday to center my career on.

    <h4>My Favorite Parts</h4>

    <p>
        What I liked the most about my program was its flexibility. There was a wide range of projects available for me to work on, and I had numerous opportunities to shadow various people, from DevOps engineers to Data engineers, doing their jobs.

    <p>
        Another thing I really like about Northrop Grumman is their wide variety of products. They have business in anything from aviation to aerospace, from cybersecurity to sensor development. This makes me feel like whatever I want to do, I can accomplish it with a career at Northrop.
