    <!--For this project, I have decided to make a website showing my
         appreciation for sea otters. I chose this topic not only because sea
          otters are my favorite animals, but also because I want to spread
        awareness about how crucial sea otters are to the environment, despite
         facing endangerment. The website also features a list of otter-themed
        charities and nonprofit organizations for the user to potentially take
        action.
